# 1Overview

## 1.1Purpose and Scope

The Golden Boys Team is interested in creating a mobile application that will be useful for chatting with people by giving them the possibility to send and receive messages, send broadcast messages and more.

The chat app will provide users with the ability to log in to their account via the login page and see the messages received. A second function will allow users to view a list of people with whom the user has chatted.

The application will be created for use on a mobile device with an iOS and android platform, essentially all devices.

The user interface will be intuitive and simple to use, with 95% of new users being able to use the application without referencing the user manual.

## 1.2Goals and Objectives

The overall objective is to offer a useful and simple app to use for messaging with people.

Project Goals:

1. Create an app that functions as expected and looks great.
2. Learn about software engineering and creating a mobile app.

Project Objectives:

1. Create an app that functions in a simple and intuitive manner.

## 1.6Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Actor  | user or other software system that receives value from a user case. |
| Baselined | the work product has undergone a formal review and can only be changed through the prescribed change control procedures |
| Client or Customer | the person or organization for which this application is being built. |
| Developer | the person or organization developing the system, also sometimes called the supplier. |
| Project | activities that will lead to the production of the chat application. **       ** |
| **Chat Application** | the product that is being described here; the software system specified in this document. |
| Scenario | one path through a user case |
| Stakeholder | anyone with an interest in the project and its outcomes. This includes clients, customers, users, developers, testers, managers and executives. |
| User | the person or persons who will actually interact with the chat application. |
| Use case | describes a goal-oriented interaction between the system and an actor. A use case may define several variants called scenarios that result in different paths through the use case and usually different outcomes. |

# 2Startup Plan

## 2.1Team Organization

## 2.2Project Communications

| Event | Information | Audience | Format | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Team Meeting | Activity status: work in progress;obstacles encountered; manage incoming messages and broadcast lists | All team members | Informal meetings after class; Formal meetings as needed; Updates on application status problems when they occur | Once time a week |
| Project Status Report | Review finished items, status of prototype; review any problems, schedule slippage, programming issues | All team members, costumer | E-mail with information or In-person as customer sees fit  | Iteration Closeout |

## 2.3Technical Process

An iterative and incremental development process is planned.  Feedback will be used from each iteration to improve the next.  The first iteration will focus on basic functionality of the application.  Subsequent iterations will build upon that and incorporate more features.

## 2.4Tools

- .Programming - Python
- .Version Control – all work products will be stored in an repository

## 4.2Configuration Management Plan

The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work products:

1. All project work products will be stored in a centralized repository running on a central server.
2. All baselined documents will have a Document Control section with a change history to track initialization and subsequent changes.
3. All project work products (documents, source code, test cases, program data, test data, etc) will be stored in the repository but not all will be under change control (subject to formal change control procedures.) Only the system requirements, project plan and source code will be baselined and under configuration control.
4. Items that are subject to change control will be considered baselined after a group review at the end of the initial document creation.
5. The change control procedure once a product is baselined is:

(1) anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends an email to the rest of the team and project sponsor (i.e. Salaorni) describing the change, reason for the change, expected schedule impact, and time line for integrating the change.

(2) if no one responds to the group within 2 days with a reason for why the change request shouldn&#39;t be permitted, it will be considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.

1. (3)if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their opinion. At the end of the meeting a democratic vote will be held to decide whether or not the change should be allowed.
2. (4)if a change takes place, the initiator must collaborate with the project manager to update the schedule.

# 5Supporting Process Plans

## 5.1Risk Management Plan

| Rank | Risk | Probability of Loss | Size of Loss | Risk Exposure | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Schedule / time line delivery | Likely | Major | High | Mitigate: Stick to the schedule. |
| 2 | Improve the communication with the server | Likely | Moderate | Moderate | Avoid: breakdown of the server engine. |
| 3 | Learning curve for new tools and technologies longer than expected | Unlikely | Moderate | Moderate | Buy Information: Begin working on a basic prototype early to test out fundamental programming concepts &amp; knowledge |
| 4 | Data feed not available from the server | Unlikely | Minor | Low | Avoid: instead of using a feed from the server, it depends on access to the app and extracts the information requested from users who use the application. |

## 5.2Test Plan

The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing, and a schedule detailing the tasks, owners, and time line.

The test plan will be available in a separate document in the version control system at: http://134.193.128.7/svn/cs451/branches/team1/Team1\_Test\_Plan.doc

## 5.3Product Acceptance Plan

At the end of each iteration, the prototype created will be tested to ensure that it meets the requirements of that iteration. An environment like the iPhone simulator and the Android simulator can be used to test the functionality instead of the app loaded on a real smartphone.

For the final iteration, product acceptance tests will ensure that the prototype works as expected with user data.
