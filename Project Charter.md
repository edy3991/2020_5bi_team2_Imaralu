| **Stakeholders and Expectations:** Team: All of us, except the manager, create a client by programming in python the correct messages&#39;s header.Manager Imaralu: The manager has the task to create a server to give us the possibility to             communicate together. |
| **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**: The purpose of this project is to communicate together and send to everyone messages. We can send different type of messages, for examples private message, broadcast message or multicast message. Without the server we can&#39;t go anyway we need it because the server is connected to internet and we are connected to him and so we can send message to us. |

| **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:** Every Tuesday we work on the project 3 hours and sometimes at home. |
| **Success Criteria** : The project is considered a success because in the end we do all the things we need to do and success to send message. |
| **Scope** : All of us can send messages to everyone (in the team, of course) and the server is working very well. |
| **Risks and obstacles to success** :  A risk was the time, that we were afraid about it and now is not a problem. |
